# README Generator

## Description

- My motivation was to create a tool using Node Package Manager and the Inquirer Package to create a readme generated by the user's input.
- To learn more about NPM and using the internal console on VS Code
- It makes it easier to complete a README and automates most of the process.
- I learned how to use npm, inquirer, template literals, and writing files.
